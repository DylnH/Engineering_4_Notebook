### Assignment Description

Write your assignment description here. It should be at least a few sentences.

### Evidence 

Pictures / Gifs of your work should go here.  You need to communicate what your thing does. For code only assignments like the Python calculator, include a screenshot of the output of the code.

### Wiring

This may not be applicable to all assignments. Anything where you wire something up, include the wiring diagram here.

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience?  Your ultimate goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
