### Assignment Description

In this assignment, we created a number generator that would pick a random number from 1-6. For this assignment, we needed to use "import random" which is a function that is used to select random results out of possible outcomes. This assignment, if done correctly, should have relatively clean code and should be really fun to use.

### Wiring

This may not be applicable to all assignments. Anything where you wire something up, include the wiring diagram here.

### Reflection

What went wrong / was challenging, how'd you figure it out, and what did you learn from that experience?  Your ultimate goal for the reflection is to pass on knowledge that will make this assignment better or easier for the next person. Think about your audience for this one, which may be "future you" (when you realize you need some of this code in three months), me, or your college admission committee!
